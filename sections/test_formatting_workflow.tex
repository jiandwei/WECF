\section{Test Formatting}

\begin{theorem}[Test Theorem]
    This has intentionally bad indentation and formatting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First item
        \item Second item with bad indent
        \item Third item
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Here is a proof with poor formatting:
    \[
        y = x + 1
    \]
    The proof is complete.
\end{proof}
