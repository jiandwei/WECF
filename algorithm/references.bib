  abstract = {In a spirit close to classical Stein’s method, we introduce a new technique to derive ﬁrst order {ODEs} on diﬀerences of characteristic functions. Then, using concentration inequalities and Fourier transform tools, we convert this information into sharp bounds for the so-called smooth Wasserstein metrics which frequently arise in Stein’s method theory. Our methodolgy is particularly eﬃcient when the target density and the object of interest both satisfy biasing equations (including the zero-bias and size-bias mechanisms). In order to illustrate our technique we provide estimates for: (i) the Dickman approximation of the sum of positions of records in random permutations, (ii) quantitative limit theorems for convergence towards stable distributions, (iii) a general class of inﬁnitely divisible distributions and (iv) distributions belonging to the second Wiener chaos, that is to say, in some situations impervious to the standard procedures of Stein’s method. Except for the stable distribution, our bounds are sharp up to logarithmic factors. We also describe a general argument and open the way for a wealth of reﬁnements and other applications.},

Since it is nonparametric, the procedure avoids the difficulties associated with parametric model selection, model fitting and parameter estimation. We provide the theoretical foundation for the test and demonstrate its applicability via a simulation study and an analysis of financial data. Extensions to multiple changes and the case of infinite fourth moments are also discussed.},

A thorough asymptotic theory is developed for a fully functional break detection procedure as well as for a break date estimator, assuming a ﬁxed break size and a shrinking break size. The latter result is utilized to derive conﬁdence intervals for the unknown break date. The main results highlight that the fully functional procedures perform best under conditions when analogous estimators based on functional principal component analysis are at their worst, namely when the feature of interest is orthogonal to the leading principal components of the data. The theoretical ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study in ﬁnite samples. An application to annual temperature curves illustrates the practical relevance of the procedures proposed.},

If the break magnitude is small, the least-squares estimator of the break date has two modes at the ends of the finite sample period, regardless of the true break location. To solve this problem, I suggest an alternative estimator based on a modification of the least-squares objective function. The modified objective function incorporates estimation uncertainty that varies across potential break dates. The new break point estimator is consistent and has a unimodal finite sample distribution under small break magnitudes. A limit distribution is provided under an in-fill asymptotic framework. Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the new estimator outperforms the least-squares estimator. I apply the method to estimate the break date in U.S. and U.K. stock return prediction models.},

In this companion paper, we consider practical issues for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a {GAUSS} program.

The main aspects are the properties of the estimators, including the estimates of the break dates, and the construction of tests that allow inference to be made about the presence of structural change and the number of breaks. We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.},

In contrast to independent and identically distributed data, the limiting distributions of the statistics are shown to depend on the long run rather than the short-run variance of relevant sample moments. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test statistics for symmetry and normality have good ﬁnite sample size and power. However, size distortions render testing for kurtosis almost meaningless except for distributions with thin tails such as the normal distribution. Nevertheless, this general weakness of testing for kurtosis is of little consequence for testing normality. Combining skewness and kurtosis as in Bera and Jarque (1981) is still a useful test of normality provided the limiting variance accounts for the serial correlation in the data.},

  abstract     = {Objectives Sedation has been established for {GI} endoscopic procedures in most countries, but it is also associated with an added risk of complications. Reported complication rates are variable due to different study methodologies and often limited sample size.
                  Designs Acute sedation-associated complications were prospectively recorded in an electronic endoscopy documentation in 39 study centres between December 2011 and August 2014 (median inclusion period 24 months). The sedation regimen was decided by each study centre.
                  Results A total of 368 206 endoscopies was recorded; 11\% without sedation. Propofol was the dominant drug used (62\% only, 22.5\% in combination with midazolam). Of the sedated patients, 38 (0.01\%) suffered a major complication, and overall mortality was 0.005\% (n=15); minor complications occurred in 0.3\%. Multivariate analysis showed the following independent risk factors for all complications: American Society of Anesthesiologists class {\textgreater}2 ({OR} 2.29) and type and duration of endoscopy. Of the sedation regimens, propofol monosedation had the lowest rate ({OR} 0.75) compared with midazolam (reference) and combinations ({OR} 1.0–1.5). Compared with primary care hospitals, tertiary referral centres had higher complication rates ({OR} 1.61). Notably, compared with sedation by a two-person endoscopy team (endoscopist/assistant; 53.5\% of all procedures), adding another person for sedation (nurse, physician) was associated with higher complication rates ({ORs} 1.40–4.46), probably due to higher complexity of procedures not evident in the multivariate analysis.
                  Conclusions This large multicentre registry study confirmed that severe acute sedation-related complications are rare during {GI} endoscopy with a very low mortality. The data are useful for planning risk factor-adapted sedation management to further prevent sedation-associated complications in selected patients.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel family of test statistics to detect the presence of changepoints in a sequence of dependent, possibly multivariate, functional-valued observations. Our approach allows to test for a very general class of changepoints, including the “classical” case of changes in the mean, and even changes in the whole distribution. Our statistics are based on a generalisation of the empirical energy distance; we propose weighted functionals of the energy distance process, which are designed in order to enhance the ability to detect breaks occurring at sample endpoints. The limiting distribution of the maximally selected version of our statistics requires only the computation of the eigenvalues of the covariance function, thus being readily implementable in the most commonly employed packages, e.g. R. We show that, under the alternative, our statistics are able to detect changepoints occurring even very close to the beginning/end of the sample. In the presence of multiple changepoints, we propose a binary segmentation algorithm to estimate the number of breaks and the locations thereof. Simulations show that our procedures work very well in finite samples. We complement our theory with applications to financial and temperature data.},

It is proposed that stationarity tests constructed from indicator variables be used to test against the hypothesis that the copula is changing over time. Tests associated with different quantiles may point to changes in different parts of the copula. The tests are still effective when prefiltering is carried out to correct for persistent changes in volatility. However, a “median quadrant association test” that is robust to changing volatility provides a good overall test against a time-varying copula. An empirical illustration on financial contagion is provided. ({JEL}: C12, G32)},

  abstract     = {For multiple change-points detection of high-dimensional time series, we provide asymptotic theory concerning the consistency and the asymptotic distribution of the breakpoint statistics and estimated break sizes. The theory backs up a simple two-step procedure for detecting and estimating multiple change-points. The proposed two-step procedure involves the maximum of a {MOSUM} (moving sum) type statistics in the first step and a {CUSUM} (cumulative sum) refinement step on an aggregated time series in the second step. Thus, for a fixed time-point, we can capture both the biggest break across different coordinates and aggregating simultaneous breaks over multiple coordinates. Extending the existing high-dimensional Gaussian approximation theorem to dependent data with jumps, the theory allows us to characterize the size and power of our multiple change-point test asymptotically. Moreover, we can make inferences on the breakpoints estimates when the break sizes are small. Our theoretical setup incorporates both weak temporal and strong or weak crosssectional dependence and is suitable for heavy-tailed innovations. A robust long-run covariance matrix estimation is proposed, which can be of independent interest. An application on detecting structural changes of the U.S. unemployment rate is considered to illustrate the usefulness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Parametric mixture models are commonly used in applied work, especially empirical economics, where these models are often employed to learn for example about the proportions of various types in a given population. This paper examines the inference question on the proportions (mixing probability) in a simple mixture model in the presence of nuisance parameters when sample size is large. It is well known that likelihood inference in mixture models is complicated due to (1) lack of point identification, and (2) parameters (for example, mixing probabilities) whose true value may lie on the boundary of the parameter space. These issues cause the profiled likelihood ratio ({PLR}) statistic to admit asymptotic limits that differ discontinuously depending on how the true density of the data approaches the regions of singularities where there is lack of point identification. This lack of uniformity in the asymptotic distribution suggests that confidence intervals based on pointwise asymptotic approximations might lead to faulty inferences. This paper examines this problem in details in a finite mixture model and provides possible fixes based on the parametric bootstrap. We examine the performance of this parametric bootstrap in Monte Carlo experiments and apply it to data from Beauty Contest experiments. We also examine small sample inferences and projection methods.},

Most existing estimation and testing methods are designed for models without endogeneity. Little attention has been paid to models with endogeneous regressors, which may arise in many scenarios in economics. In this paper, we first consider a time-varying coefficient time series model with potential time-varying endogeneity. A local linear two stage least squared estimation is developed to estimate coefficient functions. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator are derived. Furthermore, a nonparametric test is proposed to check smooth structural changes as well as abrupt structural breaks with possibly unknown change points in regression models with potential endogeneity. The idea is to compare the fitted values of the unrestricted nonparametric time-varying coefficient model and the restricted constant parameter model. The test has an asymptotic N(0,1) distribution and does not require any prior information about the alternatives. A simulation study highlights the merits of the proposed estimator and test.

  title    = {On the fragmentation of production in the us},
  abstract = {What is the average number of production stages for the {US}? Is production more fragmented now than decades ago? To answer these questions, I develop two simple measures of vertical fragmentation of production chains across plants using input-output tables. Against common belief, I ﬁnd that production has become less vertically fragmented over the past 50 years, whether I include services or focus on tradable goods. At least half of this decrease corresponds to a shift of value-added towards industries that are closer to ﬁnal demand, while early stages contribute less to the value of ﬁnal goods. Also, the production of more complex goods appears to be relatively less vertically fragmented. I show that international trade has provided new opportunities to fragment production and dampened the overall decline in vertical fragmentation. Finally, I provide an alternative application of this index to the study of comparative advantage along production chains: I show that goods involving fewer production stages and closer to ﬁnal demand are more likely to be imported to the {US} from rich countries.},

We further construct a class of derivative tests to gauge possible sources of structural breaks, which is asymptotically more powerful than the smoothed nonparametric tests for structural breaks. Simulation studies show that our method performs well in determining the appropriate number of breaks and estimating the unknown breaks. Furthermore, the proposed tests have reasonable size and excellent power in finite samples. In an application to exchange rate returns, our tests are able to detect structural breaks in distribution and locate the break dates. Our tests also indicate that the documented breaks appear to occur in variance and higher-order moments, but not so often in mean.},

The existing literature usually specifies the time-varying coefficient vector as a stationary stochastic process, a deterministic function of time, and a unit root process, respectively. In this paper, we propose two tests to distinguish these three specifications. Both test statistics follow asymptotic normal distributions under the respective null hypotheses and diverge to infinity in probability under the corresponding alternatives. To improve the finite sample performance of the tests, we propose a dependent wild bootstrap to obtain the bootstrap critical value (or P-value) and establish its asymptotic validity. Simulation studies show that our bootstrap-based tests perform reasonably well in finite samples. We apply the proposed tests to the time-varying specifications of the equity return’s predictive model, the U.S. Taylor rule, and inflation persistence, respectively. The results suggest that a unit root process is favored for the first application, whereas a deterministic function of time should be adopted for the latter two applications.},

These tests have asymptotic distributions that are nuisance-parameter free and they are correctly sized and very powerful for detecting breaks in the parameters of the conditional mean and conditional variance. A power comparison with the tests of Rossi and Sekhposyan (2013) shows that our tests are more powerful across the models considered in their work. We analyze the stability of a dynamic Phillips curve and find that the best one-step-ahead density forecast of changes in inflation is generated by a Markov switching model that allows state shifts in the mean and variance of inflation changes as well as in the coefficient that links inflation and unemployment.},

In the second step, via an iterative procedure, we conduct post-{NNR} profile {GMM} estimation of the slope coefficient, factors, and factor loadings, with an improved convergence rate for the estimate of the slope coefficient. We establish the asymptotic properties of the preliminary estimates and the iterative estimates, and propose an efficient profile {GMM} estimator. We also study the determination of the number of factors and propose Hausman tests for the exogeneity of the regressor. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the proposed estimation and testing methods work well in the determination of the number of factors, the estimation of the model parameters and the test for exogeneity. As an empirical application, we apply our model and method to study the price elasticity of U.S. imports.},

  abstract     = {Functional data often arise from measurements on fine time grids and are obtained by separating an almost continuous time record into natural consecutive intervals, for example, days. The functions thus obtained form a functional time series, and the central issue in the analysis of such data consists in taking into account the temporal dependence of these functional observations. Examples include daily curves of financial transaction data and daily patterns of geophysical and environmental data. For scalar and vector valued stochastic processes, a large number of dependence notions have been proposed, mostly involving mixing type distances between σ-algebras. In time series analysis, measures of dependence based on moments have proven most useful (autocovariances and cumulants). We introduce a moment-based notion of dependence for functional time series which involves m-dependence. We show that it is applicable to linear as well as nonlinear functional time series. Then we investigate the impact of dependence thus quantified on several important statistical procedures for functional data. We study the estimation of the functional principal components, the long-run covariance matrix, change point detection and the functional linear model. We explain when temporal dependence affects the results obtained for i.i.d. functional observations and when these results are robust to weak dependence.},

Asymptotic results are presented under conditions allowing for low-order moments and serial dependence in the data establishing the limiting null-distribution of the proposed test statistics, as well as their consistency to detect and localize change points in the distribution of functional data. A key consideration in defining these test statistics is the measure used to integrate the {CUSUM} process over function space. We show that using a measure generated by Brownian motion leads to generally consistent tests. Further, using this measure allows for computationally simple approximations of the necessary integrals, as well as simulation and permutation-based methods to calibrate detection thresholds for change point analysis. The proposed methods are thoroughly investigated and compared to other existing functional data change point methods in simulation experiments, and are further applied to detect change points in models for continuous electricity demand and high-frequency asset price returns.},

Across countries, export composition drives {VAX} ratios, with exporters of Manufactures having lower ratios. Across sectors, the {VAX} ratio for Manufactures is low relative to Services, primarily because Services are used as an intermediate to produce manufacturing exports. Across bilateral partners, {VAX} ratios vary widely and contain information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. We document specifically that bilateral production linkages, not variation in the composition of exports, drive variation in bilateral {VAX} ratios. Finally, bilateral imbalances measured in value added differ from gross trade imbalances. Most prominently, the U.S.–China imbalance in 2004 is 30–40\% smaller when measured in value added.},

In this paper, we discuss a model comparison methodology which addresses these issues. We advocate a Bayesian approach and show how such an approach can be implemented in practice.

In particular, the extra power enhancement component enlarges the region where the proposed test has power, and results in stable power performance when breaks are sparse in the alternative hypothesis. Furthermore, we impose a latent group structure on the subjects with heterogenous break points and introduce an easy-to-implement clustering algorithm with an information criterion to consistently estimate the unknown group number and membership. The estimated group structure improves the convergence property of the break point estimate. Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications show that the proposed estimation and testing techniques have satisfactory performance in finite samples.},

The method is applied to the tail behavior of {DJIA} futures returns. The sample period covered various recent financial crises, and ran from October 1999 to December 2003, enabling assessment of the relationships between changes in the tail shape of returns distribution and known extreme events in financial markets. The empirical results demonstrate the existence of at least one break point in the left and common tails of the {DJIA} futures returns distribution during the sample period, and the mean tail-index levels in different regimes classified by estimated break points display an increase in the left and common tails that coincides the phenomenon of gradually decreasing financial turbulence in {DJIA} futures contracts. The empirical evidence indicates that the structural changes in the tail behavior of the distribution of {DJIA} futures returns are associated more with negative shocks than positive ones, creating differences in risk management between long and short investors in futures markets.},

These components allow us to reconstruct the original functional data and compute the residuals. To model the temporal patterns in the residuals, we again perform dynamic functional principal component analysis and extract its estimated principal components and the associated scores for the residuals. As a byproduct, we introduce a geometrically decaying weighted approach to assign higher weights to the most recent data than those from the distant past. Using the Swedish age-specific mortality rates from 1751 to 2022, we demonstrate that the weighted dynamic functional factor model can produce more accurate point and interval forecasts, particularly for male series exhibiting higher volatility.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers issues related to estimation, inference, and computation with multiple structural changes that occur at unknown dates in a system of equations. Changes can occur in the regression coefficients and/or the covariance matrix of the errors. We also allow arbitrary restrictions on these parameters, which permits the analysis of partial structural change models, common breaks that occur in all equations, breaks that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth. The method of estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal errors. The limiting distributions are obtained under more general assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose likelihood ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of no structural change and to select the number of changes. Structural change tests with restrictions on the parameters can be constructed to achieve higher power when prior information is present. For computation, an algorithm for an efficient procedure is proposed to construct the estimates and test statistics. We also introduce a novel locally ordered breaks model, which allows the breaks in different equations to be related yet not occurring at the same dates.},

The objective of this chapter is to understand what we have learned about forecasting in the presence of instabilities. The empirical evidence raises a multitude of questions. If in-sample tests provide poor guidance to out-of-sample forecasting ability, what should researchers do? If there are statistically significant instabilities in Granger-causality relationships, how do researchers establish whether there is any Granger-causality at all? If there is substantial instability in predictive relationships, how do researchers establish which model is the “best” forecasting model? And finally, if a model forecasts poorly, why is that and how should researchers proceed to improve the forecasting models? In this chapter, we answer these questions by discussing various methodologies for inference as well as estimation that have been recently proposed in the literature.},

A more realistic alternative is to assume piecewise stationarity, where the model can change at potentially many change points. We propose a three-stage procedure for simultaneous estimation of change points and parameters of high-dimensional piecewise vector autoregressive ({VAR}) models. In the first step, we reformulate the change point detection problem as a high-dimensional variable selection one, and solve it using a penalized least square estimator with a total variation penalty. We show that the penalized estimation method over-estimates the number of change points, and propose a selection criterion to identify the change points. In the last step of our procedure, we estimate the {VAR} parameters in each of the segments. We prove that the proposed procedure consistently detects the number and location of change points, and provides consistent estimates of {VAR} parameters. The performance of the method is illustrated through several simulated and real data examples. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We suggest a Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic based on the difference of the estimated innovation distributions built from the first ⌊ns⌋and the last n − ⌊ns⌋ residuals, respectively (0 ≤ s ≤ 1). Weak convergence of the underlying stochastic process to a Gaussian process is proved under the null hypothesis of no change point. The result implies that the test is asymptotically distribution-free. Consistency against fixed alternatives is shown. The small sample performance of the proposed test is investigated in a simulation study and the test is applied to a data example.},

We establish the asymptotic normality of our {GTWFE} estimators and show that their convergence rates depend on the unknown degree of parameter heterogeneity. To make a uniform inference on the common slope component, we propose a novel triple-bootstrap procedure to estimate the asymptotic variance. Simulations show the superb performance of our estimators and inference procedure.

The change point \${\textbackslash}nu\$ is unknown. The problem is to raise an alarm as soon as possible after the distribution changes from \$F\_0\$ to \$F\_1\$ (detect the change), but to avoid false alarms. Pollak found a version of the Shiryayev-Roberts procedure to be asymptotically optimal for the problem of minimizing the average run length to detection over all stopping times which satisfy a given constraint on the rate of false alarms. Here we find that this procedure is strictly optimal for a slight reformulation of the problem he considered. Explicit formulas are developed for the calculation of the average run length (both before and after the change) for the optimal stopping time.},

This inconsistency is examined by investigating multiple structural changes in the {NKPC} for the U.S. between 1960 and 2005, employing both inflation expectations survey data and a rational expectations approximation. We find that forward-looking behavior plays a smaller role during the high and volatile inflation regime to 1981 than in the subsequent period of moderate inflation, providing empirical support for sticky price models over the last two decades. A break in the intercept of the {NKPC} is also identified around 2001 and this may be associated with U.S. monetary policy in that period.},

  abstract   = {This paper introduces two novel criteria: one for feature selection and another for feature elimination in the context of best subset selection, which is a benchmark problem in statistics and machine learning. From the perspective of optimization, we revisit the classical selection and elimination criteria in traditional best subset selection algorithms, revealing that these classical criteria capture only partial variations of the objective function after the entry or exit of features. By formulating and solving optimization subproblems for feature entry and exit exactly, new selection and elimination criteria are proposed, proved as the optimal decisions for the current entry-and-exit process compared to classical criteria. Replacing the classical selection and elimination criteria with the proposed ones generates a series of enhanced best subset selection algorithms. These generated algorithms not only preserve the theoretical properties of the original algorithms but also achieve significant meta-gains without increasing computational cost across various scenarios and evaluation metrics on multiple tasks such as compressed sensing and sparse regression.},

  abstract     = {In multiple change-point problems, different data segments often follow different distributions, for which the changes may occur in the mean, scale or the entire distribution from one segment to another. Without the need to know the number of change-points in advance, we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to detecting multiple change-points. Our method does not impose any parametric assumption on the underlying distributions of the data sequence, which is thus suitable for detection of any changes in the distributions. The number of change-points is determined by the Bayesian information criterion and the locations of the change-points can be estimated via the dynamic programming algorithm and the use of the intrinsic order structure of the likelihood function. Under some mild conditions, we show that the new method provides consistent estimation with an optimal rate. We also suggest a prescreening procedure to exclude most of the irrelevant points prior to the implementation of the nonparametric likelihood method. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance of identifying multiple change-points in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time.},
